# CWINE v0.01

## A Comic Twine Web App/Tool/Something!

**STILL MASSIVELY UNFINISHED!** Ok, thanks!

## SORT OF WORKING FEATURES

- Editor display Panels and panel elements
- Saving/Loading to JSON
- Runtime without any interactivity *at all* (actually it's broken right now, SORRY!)

## TO-DO

- Hook up Panel and Panel Element properties
- Functionality to "Add New Panel/Panel Element" in editor
- Fix the runtime again, ugh..

## IN THE FUTURE

- *MORE NODES!*
- Random node (goto a random panel), Condition node (goto a panel based on if statement), Set Global Variable node, etc.
- Some sort of string input, random input nodes, so you can plug random thing into a speech bubble.
